#SimpleChat

I'm learning how to use sockets in .NET. 

-This is an instant messaging application that works on local networks.
-Currently only supports P2P connection by each client connecting to the other's IP address and (arbitrary) port.
-Server supporting multiple clients is ~~in development~~ released but is really bad at the moment.
